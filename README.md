Data shared by insights-results-* microservices.

## Messages

Data (messages) to be consumed by Insights Results Aggregator

### Mock data for aggregator

Data to be consumed by aggregator through Kafka broker is prepared in `messages/` subdirectory.
These data can be send to Insights Results Aggregator by using the script called `produce.sh` or `produce_50k_messages.sh`.
The mentioned tools are available at https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-results-aggregator-utils/blob/master/input/produce.sh and
https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-results-aggregator-utils/blob/master/input/produce_50k_messages.sh

Several types of data are prepared there:

* `messages/results_no_tutorial/r_[0-9]*.json` - real data analyzed from test clusters
* `messages/results_tutorial/r_tutorial_[0-9]*.json` - real data analyzed from test clusters with added tutorial rule result
* `messages/normal/result*.json` - artificially created data
* `messages/normal/big_resuts.json` - file with most reports created by joining several real data (no cluster is in the state when all rules fail)
* `messages/normal/big_results_tutorial.json` - the same, but with tutorial rule result
* `messages/normal/big_results_no_skips.json` - the same, but no skipped rules are stored
* `messages/normal/big_results_no_skips_tutorial.json` - the same, but with tutorial rule result
* `messages/normal/no_hits.json` - data with no rule hits (ie. the cluster is healthy)
* `messages/normal/no_hits_no_skips.json` - data with no rule hits and no skips (ie. there's no health check performed)
* `messages/normal/tutorial_only.json` - report with only tutorial rule hit
* `messages/normal/05_rules_hits.json` - report with exactly 5 rule hits
* `messages/normal/10_rules_hits.json` - report with exactly 10 rule hits
* `messages/normal/15_rules_hits.json` - report with exactly 15 rule hits
* `messages/broken/added_items*.json` - reports with added items (that should not be in there)
* `messages/broken/mutated_items*.json` - reports with mutated items
* `messages/broken/without_*.json` - reports without one or more attributes
* `messages/invalid/added_*.json` - invalid JSONs (wrong structure) with added random lines
* `messages/invalid/deleted_*.json` - invalid JSONs (wrong structure) with removed lines
* `messages/invalid/shuffled_*.json` - invalid JSONs (wrong structure) with shuffled lines
* `messages/invalid/mutated_*.json` - invalid JSONs (wrong structure) with mutated lines
* `messages/invalid/all_*.json` - invalid JSONs (wrong structure) with lines changed in many ways

## Test data

`github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-results-aggregator-data/testdata` package contains files with repeated data 
to be used in tests

## Reports generated by Insights Reports Aggregator

Reports are stored in `reports` directory. It is splitted into three subdirectories:

* `original` contains reports as read from Insights Reports Aggregator
* `formatted` contains reports as formatted JSON files (for better readability)
* `edn` contains reports converted into EDN format

### Clusters that return 'static' rule results

### Cluster that returns no results (ie just empty report)
